### What is `bottom_nav_layout`?
It is a quick flutter app layout for building an app with a bottom nav bar. You can get an app with fluent behavior running in 15 lines of code.

### Why `bottom_nav_layout`?
 - Eliminates all boilerplate code for bottom nav bar coordination.
 - Uses identical APIs with the underlying bottom bars.
 - Offers additional common features, all of which are optional.
   - Page state preservation
   - Lazy page loading
   - Page backstack
   - Back button navigation management
 - Works with any bottom bar you wish. Use the material desing, grab one from pub.dev or use your own.

# Usage
## Installation
Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file.
```yaml
dependencies:
  bottom_nav_layout: latest_version
```

## Import
```dart
import 'package:bottom_nav_layout/bottom_nav_layout.dart';
```

## Quick Start Example
```dart
void main() => runApp(MaterialApp(
      home: BottomNavLayout(
        // The app's destinations
        pages: [
          (_) => Center(child: Text("Welcome to bottom_nav_layout")),
          (_) => SliderPage(),
          (_) => Center(child: TextField(decoration: InputDecoration(hintText: 'Go..'))),
        ],
        bottomNavigationBar: (currentIndex, onTap) => BottomNavigationBar(
          currentIndex: currentIndex,
          onTap: onTap,
          items: [
            BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'Home'),
            BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.linear_scale), label: 'Slider'),
            BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.search), label: 'Search'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ));
```
Done. You have a complete, working application.

## Parameters
| Name | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pages` | The app's destinations. | N/A |
| `bottomNavigationBar` | The bottom navbar of the layout. | N/A |
| `savePageState` | When false, the pages are reinitialized every time they are navigated. (Material behavior). When true, the pages are initialized once and hidden/shown on navigation. (Cupertino behavior) | false |
| `lazyLoadPages` | When false, pages are created in the beginning. When true, pages are created when they are navigated for the first time. | false |
| `pageStack` | Navigation stack that remembers pages visited. Enhances back button management on Android. | ReorderToFrontPageStack for Android, NoPageStack for iOS |
| `bottomBarWrapper` | Widget that wrap bottom bar. | (bar) => bar |
| `extendBody` | Passed to [`Scaffold.extendBody`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold/extendBody.html). | false |
| `resizeToAvoidBottomInset` | Passed to [`Scaffold.resizeToAvoidBottomInset`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold/resizeToAvoidBottomInset.html). | true |

# Page State Preservation
The state changes you made in a page such as scroll amount, sub-navigation, form inputs etc. are preserved. You can enable it as per [Cupertino Design Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/navigation/) or disable it as per [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/components/bottom-navigation#behavior)
```dart
savePageState: true, // Default is false
```

# Lazy Page Loading
The layout offers the option to lazily create the pages using the passed in page builders. When `lazyLoadPages` is set to true, the pages are not created until they are navigated to for the first time. This is useful when a non-initial page;
 - Has a load animation.
 - Runs a heavy process that is not needed until the page is opened.
 ```dart
 lazyLoadPages: true, // Default is false
 ```

# Page Back Stack
The layout remembers the order of pages navigated and when back button is pressed, navigates back to the previously navigated page.

There are many useful page back stack behaviors implemented such as reorder-to-front and replace-except-first. You can also implement your own.

You also specify the `initialPage` inside `PageStack`.

```dart
// Default is ReorderToFrontPageStack for Android and NoPageStack for iOS.
pageStack: ReorderToFrontPageStack(initialPage: 0),
```

[Page Back Stack Documentation](https://github.com/m-azyoksul/bottom_nav_layout/tree/main/docs/PageBackStack) for details.

# In-Page Navigation

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32205084/125260520-1024f380-e309-11eb-8c2d-4b10fc3dbc41.png">

  <i>Figure: Flat Navigation</i>
</p>

 1. Allows the layout to manage a [flat navigation pattern](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/navigation/).
 2. Let's us go back to the root route, when the bottom bar item on the current index is selected again.

To do this, the page should have a `Navigator` widget and the same instance of the key should be used as the `Navigator`'s key in the corresponding page.

Example code to be added here...

To use keys, pass all the keys you passed to the pages in the same order.
```dart
keys: <GlobalKey<NavigatorState>?>[
  homePageKey,
  null, // If a page doesn't use a key, pass null so that layout knows the order
  placePageKey,
],
```

# Different Bottom Bars
So far, we only worked on Material bottom nav bar. The layout supports any bottom bar.

Example usage of [`flutter_snake_navigationbar`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_snake_navigationbar):

```dart
bottomNavigationBar: (currentIndex, onTap) => SnakeNavigationBar.color(
  currentIndex: currentIndex,
  onTap: onTap,
  items: [
    BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'Home'),
    BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.linear_scale), label: 'Slider'),
    BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.search), label: 'Search'),
  ],
),
```


# Bar Styling
### Bar Wrapper
Do you not like how your bottom bar looks? You can style it by wrapping it inside any widget.
```dart
bottomBarWrapper: (bottomBar) => Padding(
  padding: EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(16, 0, 16, 0),
  child: bottomBar,
),
```

### Extend Body
You can have the page extend behind the bottom bar.
```dart
extendBody: true,
```

# Improvements
 - I am planning to add more bottom bar designs, preferably from pub.dev.
 - Tell me if you want to see a feature your app has/needs in this package. I will do my best to integrate that.
 - I am also considering to make a drawer_nav_layout package. If you are interested, let me know!
